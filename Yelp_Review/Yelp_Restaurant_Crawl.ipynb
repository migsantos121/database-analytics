However, luckily I picked up a tip from another review that you can get put on the waitlist through the Yelp app.  The caveat is that you need to be within 5 miles of the restaurant.  Welp, I drove down to SJ and as soon as I got within the radius, I added myself to the waitlist.  I was a little horrified that there were 30 something people ahead of me (the app tells you), but this was about an hour before the actual time we wanted to eat.  Fingers crossed that waitlist goes down quickly.  It's cool in that you can see where you are in the queue from the app.  Note that it does require you to check into the restaurant by a given time.  Upon check in, the host seemed to indicate the wait time from Yelp isn't 100% accurate.  This made me worry, but I think we eventually got our seats maybe 15 to 20 minutes after the posted time.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant layout is fine and has both indoor and outdoor seating.  We ordered bottomless mimosas, some small starters, and some standard breakfast items (omelettes, sausage, eggs, etc).  \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a bit weird, but we noticed the water glasses smelled.  It wasn't awful, but it bore the lingering scent of having been dried with an old dish rag that hadn't been washed for a while.  One of our plates also had some residue and my napkin had some small stains.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Bottomless mimosas - I was a bit disappointed on how watered down it was, especially for such a popular brunch spot.  It was mostly OJ (perhaps water), and a splash of champagne.  It came in the small OJ glasses - the refill pace was OK, though there were times it went dry longer than I would like.  I like my alcohol, but won't be ordering this again as $12 is pricey for OJ.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The food - it was OK.  Nothing to really write home about.  Entrees will set you back about $15-$17 on average.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, The Table is OK, but I don't have any compelling reason to come back.  Waits are long, mimosas are weak, and food is mediocre.  Service was at least fine.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "I had such high hopes for this place. Out of all the brunch spots in Willow Glen, this one always appears to be the liveliest and most crowded. I was looking forward to seeing what all the hype was about.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, there's the long wait times. This is to be expected on a Sunday morning. I believe we waited about 90 minutes for a table for 2. I didn't mind because it was a beautiful day outside. We walked down to Starbucks to grab some coffee and killed time by checking out all the cute dogs in the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "We eventually receive a text that our table is ready and to check in with the host. Cool. We waited a couple of minutes because there's two random girls standing in front of the host station. Once we realized they weren't in line, we walked up to the station and waited ANOTHER couple of minutes to get the host's attention. He was there doing nothing important. Not sure why it took him so long to acknowledge our existence. He tells us to check in with the host inside. Ok, maybe the text should've been clearer about who we needed to check in with. So we walk inside and the two random girls from outside follow us. The host inside acknowledges them first even though we got there before them and seated them first. I'm already starting to get mad because we waited over an hour for this table and now I feel like I'm being ignored. We waited ANOTHER couple of minutes for them to get the table ready, even though the text said our table was already ready for us. Hmm, maybe we wouldn't have to wait so long if they didn't seat those girls before us.\n",
      "\n",
      "I order the vegetarian chilaquiles and bottomless mimosa, of course. The food was fine. I'm glad the server asked if I wanted my poached egg to be cooked a little bit more, but besides that, the food didn't blow me away. Maybe I'm spoiled by all the awesome brunch places in SF and Oakland, but it was just ok. I think my experience was mostly ruined by the bad service here. When I order a bottomless mimosa, I expect my glass to be refilled every single time it's empty. That's the definition of bottomless and that's how every brunch place I go to works. The server did a horrible job at doing this. By the time we were eating, it wasn't super busy anymore. We watched her do \"busy work\" like folding napkins and etc. I used to be a bartender, so I know what it's like. You try to keep yourself busy when it's slow, but our glasses were empty and there were empty plates on our table. The server's job is to ask us if we're done with the plates, so they may remove them, and to refill our bottomless mimosas, but she was too busy folding napkins. \n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered the beignets as dessert, but I wish we hadn't because they were already rushing us to pay and leave. I just wanted to enjoy the beignets and have some more of my BOTTOMLESS mimosa, but I no longer felt welcomed here. The server already left the check and was checking back to see if we paid but didn't bother to refill our drinks. We weren't obviously done if we barely just got the beignets.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would've came back despite the food just being ok if the service was better, but I honestly don't want to come back here again. There are so many other brunch places in the area, so why bother?\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "AMAZING FOOD, great venue, horrendous wait time, and average wait service. I will concede that the wait is justified since the place is really popular and the food is really good, so I will say that it is worth the wait. We ended up waiting about an hour to get seated, but once we were seated our food came out in a timely manner. As for the service, our waiter came off as though he really didn't want to be there and it made me reluctant to ask for more water or juice if he walked by. To be fair, it was pretty packed the day we went, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the food. Their freshly squeezed orange juice is something I highly recommend getting! It's fresh and sweet and I could probably drink it all day long. The food is quite flavorful and you can tell what is made from scratch. My boyfriend got the traditional breakfast and I got the lemon ricotta pancakes with their seasonal preserve, and we were definitely not disappointed. I LOVED the seasonal preserve that came with my pancakes, I really wish I had asked for more. My boyfriend cleared his plate before I even got through half of mine! Might have been the hunger, but he did say that his food was really good.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",

      "I'll be honest I came for the smoked salmon eggs benedict, but The Table has the most expensive smoked salmon eggs benedict I've seen anywhere. The item is $20 BEFORE tax and tip. I'm willing to pay a bit more for good food, but that's a little too much. This place should be 3 dollar signs. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes with lemon curd and blueberry compote, my friend ordered the special of the day (avocado uni toast with scrambled eggs and arugula), and we both shared the other special of the day, pull-apart monkey bread with salted caramel dipping sauce. \n",

      "Pancakes were yummy but there was no wow factor, it was honestly a very okay experience. They were just pancakes, nothing that kept me thinking about them afterwards. \n",
      "\n",
      "Can't speak for the avocado uni toast as I can't bring myself to eat anything avocado related, but my friend said it was just the right amount of food and delicious. \n",
      "\n",
      "The monkey bread was delicious - crispy on the outside, and soft and fluffy on the inside, and the salted caramel dipping sauce was a nice complement. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, they take reservations, but not for weekend brunch, only for dinners.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "I came here a few weeks ago for Sunday brunch with a friend. We arrived around 10:30 am and had to wait about 30 minutes for a table (we passed the time by walking up and down the street). Our waiter was really friendly and consistently checked on us without overdoing it. I got the veggie chilaquiles - loved all the spinach on top! My friend got the corned beef hash - she said it was delicious and super filling from all the potatoes. I also got the Kentucky Express - a bourbon drink with coffee liqueur - it was strong! Had a good kick to it ;) I would come back again, maybe on a warm summer day outside - the patio looked nice and perfectly situated at the street corner. \n",
      "\n",
      "We luckily found street parking out 3-4 spots away from the entrance. Also, the bathroom (fit for one person) was spacious and nice! I will say the tables are kinda close to each other, so watch your step if you're squeezing out. There's also at least one  spot for diners inside with a sofa and a coffee table - looked hard to have a meal there. There's also a spot outside for larger parties - a L-shaped bench with a matching table. One girl was celebrating her birthday there - seemed like an ideal spot!\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "Um yum!! The brilliance of yelp let me get on the waitlist at Table before I even got to the restaurant. It's a trendy joint with a line out the door and no real parking so it helped to get on the waitlist ahead of time. There is eventually parking once you drive through residential streets. \n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant features dinning inside and out, along with a bar. It was 11am on a Sunday with a toddler so we opted for indoor seating. They give kids crayons and a coloring sheet. Props for the crayons being in a new sanitary pack! \n",
      "\n",
      "Now on the food. We split the lemon beignets and lemon ricotta pancakes. Both delectable. The lemon curd with the beignets was scrumptious. For my entree I got the special which was a uni scramble toast. A bit steep for $22 but very very good.  I could have eaten 3 of em. My partner got the salmon Benedict with hashbrowns which were fluffy and yummy. \n",
      " \n",
      "Looking forward to trying different things on the menu!\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "The Table is seriously a gem in the South Bay. The food, the hospitality, the ambiance, the neighborhood. Everything about it just screams at you to go in and take a seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "I made a reservation via Yelp for a Valentine's Day brunch. (Dinner times were all booked already, but make lemonade out of lemons, amirite?) We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation time, but they found a table for us and seated us within 5 minutes. The place was packed and buzzing with merry customers eating and drinking and having a grand ol' time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our server came by right away and asked if we wanted anything to drink. V-Day calls for bottomless mimosas, so you can bet your bottom that my eyes made a beeline for that on the menu. The boyfriend/DD chose a non-alcoholic option: apple cranberry soda.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, everything we ordered was divine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roasted Bone Marrow. Definitely one of the more unique items on the menu and ohhhh soo good. It's seasoned and cooked perfectly, and it took all my willpower not to pick up the bone and eat it like a dog. But V-Day date etiquette, so... I behaved. Scoop the deliciousness out, spread it across the charred ciabatta bread, find yourself drooling for more, rinse and repeat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fried Chicken Sandwich. Sounds like nothing fancy, but this was seriously one of the best pieces of fried chicken I've ever had. Crispy on the outside and super juicy on the inside. Plus some Sriracha to give it a nice kick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sugar Dusted Ricotta Beignets. Soooo fluuufffffyyyyyy. These beignets are a bit denser than the usual beignets, but that doesn't mean they're less tasty. A set of 5 was perfect to share, and the lemon curd that came on the side was a perfect complement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottomless mimosas. The real deal. Our server was super attentive and refilled my glass without me ever having to flag her down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple cranberry soda. Sounds boring until you taste it and a burst of spices hits you. This is like what would happen if you turned apple pie into a soda.\n",
      "\n",
      "Totally worth it to check The Table out for a meal! Make a reservation if you're scared of the wait, or check for counter seating that's first come, first served.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "Came here for lunch and I'm already a fan! Everything here is on point-- the wait time was none because the counter is open seating (regular table seating was only about 30-45mins), the service was great (there's always someone walking around),  everything was affordable and not overpriced ($10 mimosas, dishes around $12-16). Only small annoyance is probably parking as it can get very packed but that's not the restaurant's fault.\n",
      " \n",
      "For brunch, I got the fried chicken biscuit with hash browns (instead of potato wedges) and my boyfriend got the hangtown fry (egg, fried oysters). I really enjoyed both of the dishes. The fried chicken wasn't overcooked and dry, there were flavor and seasoning in every bite (even in the thicker part of the chicken) and the egg was made perfectly (not overcooked, flowy egg). Hashbrown was unique (and full of flavor!) in the sense that they mix the shredded potatoes with onions. It was on the thicker side, so top part was crispy and little mushy on the inside. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I really enjoyed this place and would definately come back! Good service, good food. Wait wasn't bad. They also do reservations for dinner.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "Okay, it's time I updated my review.  Well yelpers, after nearly two years of visiting frequently, I feel confident in reporting to you that The Table is my default restaurant in WG because of the following \"A-B-C-D-E-F's\":\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ambiance: The table is just 'comfy'. The dining area is big enough where you don't feel too cramped (unless perhaps on a busy Fri/Sat night or during a weekend breakfast rush). The space between tables is adequate, and it's rare that you'll be unable to hear your eating companion's delightful insights over the noise from the crowd surrounding you.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Bar: The lounge/bar area is my go-to spot. There is usually plenty of room at the bar, high tables near the window overlooking Willow, a small secret couch in the back (don't sit there it's mine! ;), and a large outdoor area at the corner of Lincoln & Willow that offers tables, a fire pit, more high tables and when it's cold, the heating lamps do their job.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Cocktails: So I've had my share of craft cocktails (My best friend is Michelle C. ;) and while my palate is not refined as many of you fine yelpers, the sheer volume of cocktails consumed gives me some ability to rate these delicious potions. The bartenders are friendly, fully-capable mixologists. Yes, I said mixologists. They know how to make a cocktail, and you should see the thought & refinement they put into each cocktail they offer. Only the best cocktails that are sure to appease your taste buds get the privilege to be displayed on their often-updated cocktail menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Diligent Personalities: (This point really should just be labeled Personality, but I needed a word that started with \"D\" to keep with the theme of this review). I can't say enough good things about the entire team at The Table. Seriously - everyone is great! They are attentive and responsive to all requests, genuinely care if you are enjoying yourself, and are always friendly and just as important - genuine. I'm selfishly sad to see when folks eventually leave to pursue various ventures. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Ego: There is none. Love it. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Food: Absolutely delicious and consistent(!). You can tell that the fine folks in the kitchen care about what they serve you. I've tried just about everything, but my favorites are the Shishito peppers, the cheeseburger (I add an egg on top), and the corned beef hash. Although, I am a big fan of a number of their soups too... \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, if you've read any of my reviews you know I tend to keep them short. Obviously, the Table deserved something just a little bit more to give them a ringing endorsement. I appreciate you taking the time to read this review.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "I'm not going to say it was bad, because it wasn't, but it wasn't SUPERB.  I mean, it wasn't even really close to that.  The food was fine, but the restaurant, and the location really drive up the prices, so you're not exactly getting what you pay for.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Food itself wasn't something to call home about, but they do have some interesting options.  I think the bone marrow was pretty popular, but we didn't end up ordering it.  The portions were also pretty small, which for me, is always a no-go.  I am a big boi, and I require lots of foodz!\n",
      "\n",
      "For drinks, I would just stick to beers.  They've got some good ones on tap, however, they were out on a couple of the IPAs, so that wasn't very chill.  The mixed drinks are pretty odd, and not really my thing.  I guess I just like to stick to the basics, but everyone is always trying to stand out somehow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, worth a shot, you might love it, but I probably won't be heading back this way.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "I am honestly so surprised by how underrated the food scene is in the South Bay. I don't know why everyone raves about the brunch scene in SF when we have plenty of options in the South Bay including this one. \n",
      "\n",
      "This place had popped up on several of my Yelp newsletters so I thought I would give it a try with a friend. Between the two of us, we split the Chilaquiles, omelette, and beignets. I also got a bloody mary because, hey... it was just one of those weekdays :) .The chilaquiles were probably the best I have ever had and I am SO PICKY about chilaquiles to the point that I almost never order them because I am afraid that I am going to be disappointed. The omelette was also super tasty and I NEVER like omelettes except those cooked by my mother. The beignets were also delicious and a perfect way to end the meal. Of course the bloody mary was also delicious!\n",
      "\n",
      "If I am craving brunch with my friends, this place will definitely be one of the first I suggest. I also wouldn't mind visiting them again for their happy hour or dinner as both of those menus looked great as well. Definitely a restaurant that puts the San Jose food scene on the map!\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "Really nice, upscale cafe in downtown Willow Glen. Stunning decor (reminiscent of upscale restaurants in New York/SF), and the service is friendly. The food is also top-notch, and comes in HUGE portions (you've been warned). \n",
      "We ordered the complete breakfast, sugar dusted lemon ricotta beignets, and chilaquiles breakfast. The lemon ricotta beignets were good, but you can't taste the ricotta, and they didn't taste like beignets - more like soft, fluffy doughnuts. I had to dock one star for this observation. \n",
      "The complete breakfast and the chilaquiles breakfasts, however, were really good. The chilaquiles chips were perfectly crisp, and the complete breakfast were very filling. Also the complete breakfast's hash browns were the BOMB DOT COM. Seriously, so good. Add ketchup on them for a nice kick.\n",
      "Overall, cute place and will likely be back!\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "I had high hopes for this place, but the dinner experience was lackluster. \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Arrived 15 minutes early and did not seat us even though there were plenty of tables open. \n",
      "2. Dirty bread plate, looked used with grease on it. Incomplete utensil set. \n",
      "3. A few of the potato wedges did not look good. Had some kind of mold in them and we had to ask for another set. \n",
      "4. Second set of potatoes had a piece of rock in the skin that totally killed the experience. \n",
      "5. Service was slow....\n",
      "\n",
      "Food was good. \n",
      "1. Beef tartare  - A great flavor \n",
      "2. The only burger - B+ too greasy. F for the potatoes, obviously. \n",
      "3. Beef cheek -  A pretty savory and rich plate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Restaurant manager took off the cost of the burger entree... but unfortunately I don't see myself coming back here any time soon paying for molding food and potentially losing some teeth. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Overrated.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "Came here for brunch and I love this hipster spot! \n",
      "They have desserts and so we started off with some coffee cake. \n",
      "They have bottomless mimosas and a full list of interesting brunch themed drinks.\n",
      "I got the oyster egg omelette which was bomb with some hot sauce. It came with some hash browns that they could have cooked for longer.\n",
      "My bf got the chiquilies dish which was pretty good.\n",
      "Overall it's a decent brunch spot and I'd visit again if I am in the area.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "I came here with my boo after a night of moving my millennial assets to my new home in San Jose. We ordered the mussels, a pasta dish, and something else I totally forgot. I guess I didn't enjoy it very much. The mussels were well-cooked and I loved its sauce a lot. Even dipped some bread in it for some light nibbles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Loved the service and the overall experience. We were able to sit outside enjoy the food in the midst of fresh air and muffled conversations. \n",
      "\n",
      "The complimentary mousse dessert we received looked like ice cream but totally shocked out taste buds with its lukewarmness. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'd love to take my parents here if and when they come to visit me in the burbs.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "I came here for brunch with a friend. It's been a while since I've been back here and he was recommended The Table as a place for good eats.\n",
      "\n",
      "We decided to share our food items and grab some drinks while we were at it. It's 5 o' clock somewhere!\n",
      "\n",
      "We decided to go with the Corned Beef Hash, Chilaquiles and a side of fried chicken. As for drinks, I went for the Snickerdoodle Flip and he got an Old Fashioned. Unfortunately, the one dish we wanted to try was out, the Hangtown Fry, probably for good reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Corned Beef Hash was delicious, savory with cubes of tender beef, potato, peppers, onion and topped with sous vide egg. Appreciated how this dish wasn't too salty and every component was true to its flavor instead of tasting overwhelmingly of either just corned beef or potato. \n",
      "\n",
      "Chilaquiles was probably the favorite out of everything we ordered. With pulled pork, queso fresco, poached eggs, tomatillo salsa, sour cream and chile rojo. This was probably one of the better and lighter tasting Chilaquiles I've had. The entire dish worked well and we couldn't stop eating it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The side of fried chicken was good, but nothing amazing or mind-blowing. Granted, it was crisp while maintaining a moist interior ... it was good fried chicken.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Snickerdoodle Flip reminded me of eggnog with a kick, basically Christmas in a cup but for adults. I would say this drink was a little rich for me and didn't find it easy to drink with the rest of the heavy food I had. Although, I feel like it is a good drink, well crafted and perfect for the holiday season.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service here is great, we were given a lot of recommendations and were checked up on frequently. The portions here are generous. Ingredient quality is amazing and the atmosphere of the The Table is so comfortable and welcoming. Definitely, a great place to visit whether it's for Brunch, Lunch, Dinner or just for drinks.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "Service (5/5): \n",
      "\n",
      "Me and my buddy decided to have lunch here. What had caught my eye was the bottomless mimosas . I believe there's only orange but who can go wrong with that. Parking is only street. I got lucky finding one across the street since there was construction going around ... and it was also a Sunday lunch. Pretty busy . \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, my friend didn't live too far away from this place so he was able to join the waitlist on yelp :) so by the time we get there we didn't have to wait hours ! We waited about a good 20 minutes once we had checked in. Didn't expect to wait that long but it's okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once we sat down, we were greeted by our waitress and she was pretty attentive since me and my buddy were able to get in at least 4-5 glasses of mimosas .. and by the end of lunch we were already having a good time lol!! \n",
      "\n",
      "We pretty much sat until 3pm which is when they closed but they didn't kick us out. There were still a few tables around us and people sitting at the bar that were watching the game. So me and my buddy just moved over to the fire pit area and talked and enjoyed the weather until a little after they reopened at 5. They didn't even bother us or anything!! Surprisingly ! It was a great time ! I'd definitely come back again for another Sunday mimosa day :) \n",
      "\n",
      "F O O D \n",
      "\n",
      "Crispy Potato Wedges (5/5):\n",
      "As simple as it is, it came out SUPER HOT.. and CRISPY. It was delicious. Best dish I had here hahah. Highly recommended if you like potato wedges ! Yummm. \n",
      "\n",
      "Corned Beef and Hash (3/5):\n",
      "Honestly .. I didn't care for this dish. It came in bunch of cubes. The dish also had a bunch of green bell peppers and onions. Like .... it was majority just vegetables . There was a okay amount of potatoes . But yeah. It was alright. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sugar Dusted Ricotta Beignet with Lemon curd (4/5) \n",
      "When it first came out, it looked sooooo good. Too bad It wasn't hot and fresh. It was just warm like it was sitting under a heater. My friend wasn't satisfied. When the waitress asked how we were doing, we informed her that the beignets weren't hot. And she immediately and sincerely apologized and took it back and will give us hot fresh ones. \n",
      "When it did come out, it was served to us by the manager and he ever offered us a free dish of beignets the next time we come back! How awesome are they !!!\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "I wanted to check this place out for a long time but each time their menu held me back. Why?? They don't have much chicken/fish/vegetarian option and whatever option they have is loaded with calories without much veggies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, so I did try this out place last Saturday and sorry to say was disappointed with the food. The ambience and servers and the reservations process everything was smooth, however the food was just above average. I had a hard time to choose anything from the menu and when the food arrived, I could barely see any greens on it. I didn't want to eat salad since I had it that afternoon!! \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes people like this restaurant but in my opinion they should provide more healthier and low calorie option to vegetarians and chicken/fish eaters.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "Still one of my favorite restaurants in the South Bay! It's impossible to get in for brunch on the weekends but if you're looking for dinner on a weekday they usually have reservations available! It's located in downtown Willow Glen so it's a nice walk around before or after dinner but parking can be a little tricky. The restaurant itself has a tiny lot with barely any spots but there's a parking garage and lot nearby as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "We came by on a Tuesday night with a party of 5 and were promptly seated. Service was pleasant but nothing to write home about...that's probably the only reason this is not a five star review.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food, on the other hand, was awesome. The complimentary bread is definitely unique - they are constantly baking them so they come out fresh! Rather than the usual butter or olive oil/balasamic they do olive oil and ricotta cheese which is just divine.\n",
      "We ordered:\n",
      "-Chicken liver mousse: Amazing deal at $7! They give you a healthy serving and it's both creamy and flavorful. You'll definitely need to request more crostinis.\n",
      "-Broccolini: Perfectly cooked and topped with pine nuts and cheese. \n",
      "-Steak tartare: One of my favorite food items. Theirs is served on toast with avocado so it's a little tricky to split among 5 but worth each bite. Tasted very refreshing, not muddled as some tartares can be.\n",
      "-Bone marrow: What can I say? It's bone marrow and it's delicious.\n",
      "-Pasta with mushroom and cream sauce: I usually don't order pastas but I'm a sucker for mushrooms. This pasta tasted like it was made fresh and cooked perfectly al dente. I'm not familiar with the shape but whatever it was it held the sauce perfectly. If all pasta tasted like this I would likely eat it much more often.\n",
      "-Market fish: On our day it was swordfish. We ordered this one mainly for my dad as he is not as adventurous eater as the rest of us. It was cooked well and surprisingly tender and moist but underseasoned. A good option for the healthy eater in the group (Not everyone is a bone marrow, tartare eating carnivore like me =/ )\n",
      "-Impossible burger: We ordered this mainly just to try it. It's a vegetarian burger that is supposed to taste very similar to meat. Worth a try if you haven't tried it...at least for the interesting discussion topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all a great meal and a staple restaurant for special occasions in the South Bay. Will be back!\n",
