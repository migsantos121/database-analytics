      "I knew the wait was going to be a nightmare for a weekend brunch, and they don't take reservations.  However, luckily I picked up a tip from another review that you can get put on the waitlist through the Yelp app.  The caveat is that you need to be within 5 miles of the restaurant.  Welp, I drove down to SJ and as soon as I got within the radius, I added myself to the waitlist.  I was a little horrified that there were 30 something people ahead of me (the app tells you), but this was about an hour before the actual time we wanted to eat.  Fingers crossed that waitlist goes down quickly.  It's cool in that you can see where you are in the queue from the app.  Note that it does require you to check into the restaurant by a given time.  Upon check in, the host seemed to indicate the wait time from Yelp isn't 100% accurate.  This made me worry, but I think we eventually got our seats maybe 15 to 20 minutes after the posted time.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant layout is fine and has both indoor and outdoor seating.  We ordered bottomless mimosas, some small starters, and some standard breakfast items (omelettes, sausage, eggs, etc).  \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a bit weird, but we noticed the water glasses smelled.  It wasn't awful, but it bore the lingering scent of having been dried with an old dish rag that hadn't been washed for a while.  One of our plates also had some residue and my napkin had some small stains.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Bottomless mimosas - I was a bit disappointed on how watered down it was, especially for such a popular brunch spot.  It was mostly OJ (perhaps water), and a splash of champagne.  It came in the small OJ glasses - the refill pace was OK, though there were times it went dry longer than I would like.  I like my alcohol, but won't be ordering this again as $12 is pricey for OJ.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The food - it was OK.  Nothing to really write home about.  Entrees will set you back about $15-$17 on average.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, The Table is OK, but I don't have any compelling reason to come back.  Waits are long, mimosas are weak, and food is mediocre.  Service was at least fine.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "I had such high hopes for this place. Out of all the brunch spots in Willow Glen, this one always appears to be the liveliest and most crowded. I was looking forward to seeing what all the hype was about.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, there's the long wait times. This is to be expected on a Sunday morning. I believe we waited about 90 minutes for a table for 2. I didn't mind because it was a beautiful day outside. We walked down to Starbucks to grab some coffee and killed time by checking out all the cute dogs in the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "We eventually receive a text that our table is ready and to check in with the host. Cool. We waited a couple of minutes because there's two random girls standing in front of the host station. Once we realized they weren't in line, we walked up to the station and waited ANOTHER couple of minutes to get the host's attention. He was there doing nothing important. Not sure why it took him so long to acknowledge our existence. He tells us to check in with the host inside. Ok, maybe the text should've been clearer about who we needed to check in with. So we walk inside and the two random girls from outside follow us. The host inside acknowledges them first even though we got there before them and seated them first. I'm already starting to get mad because we waited over an hour for this table and now I feel like I'm being ignored. We waited ANOTHER couple of minutes for them to get the table ready, even though the text said our table was already ready for us. Hmm, maybe we wouldn't have to wait so long if they didn't seat those girls before us.\n",
      "\n",
      "I order the vegetarian chilaquiles and bottomless mimosa, of course. The food was fine. I'm glad the server asked if I wanted my poached egg to be cooked a little bit more, but besides that, the food didn't blow me away. Maybe I'm spoiled by all the awesome brunch places in SF and Oakland, but it was just ok. I think my experience was mostly ruined by the bad service here. When I order a bottomless mimosa, I expect my glass to be refilled every single time it's empty. That's the definition of bottomless and that's how every brunch place I go to works. The server did a horrible job at doing this. By the time we were eating, it wasn't super busy anymore. We watched her do \"busy work\" like folding napkins and etc. I used to be a bartender, so I know what it's like. You try to keep yourself busy when it's slow, but our glasses were empty and there were empty plates on our table. The server's job is to ask us if we're done with the plates, so they may remove them, and to refill our bottomless mimosas, but she was too busy folding napkins. \n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered the beignets as dessert, but I wish we hadn't because they were already rushing us to pay and leave. I just wanted to enjoy the beignets and have some more of my BOTTOMLESS mimosa, but I no longer felt welcomed here. The server already left the check and was checking back to see if we paid but didn't bother to refill our drinks. We weren't obviously done if we barely just got the beignets.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would've came back despite the food just being ok if the service was better, but I honestly don't want to come back here again. There are so many other brunch places in the area, so why bother?\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "AMAZING FOOD, great venue, horrendous wait time, and average wait service. I will concede that the wait is justified since the place is really popular and the food is really good, so I will say that it is worth the wait. We ended up waiting about an hour to get seated, but once we were seated our food came out in a timely manner. As for the service, our waiter came off as though he really didn't want to be there and it made me reluctant to ask for more water or juice if he walked by. To be fair, it was pretty packed the day we went, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the food. Their freshly squeezed orange juice is something I highly recommend getting! It's fresh and sweet and I could probably drink it all day long. The food is quite flavorful and you can tell what is made from scratch. My boyfriend got the traditional breakfast and I got the lemon ricotta pancakes with their seasonal preserve, and we were definitely not disappointed. I LOVED the seasonal preserve that came with my pancakes, I really wish I had asked for more. My boyfriend cleared his plate before I even got through half of mine! Might have been the hunger, but he did say that his food was really good.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "Be sure to come early, they don't take reservations, and your wait time can be anywhere between 30 min to 1 hour. There's not much to do around either while you wait. \n",

      "I'll be honest I came for the smoked salmon eggs benedict, but The Table has the most expensive smoked salmon eggs benedict I've seen anywhere. The item is $20 BEFORE tax and tip. I'm willing to pay a bit more for good food, but that's a little too much. This place should be 3 dollar signs. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes with lemon curd and blueberry compote, my friend ordered the special of the day (avocado uni toast with scrambled eggs and arugula), and we both shared the other special of the day, pull-apart monkey bread with salted caramel dipping sauce. \n",
      "\n",
      "Pancakes were yummy but there was no wow factor, it was honestly a very okay experience. They were just pancakes, nothing that kept me thinking about them afterwards. \n",
